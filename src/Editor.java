 * Your Editor class will have a private StringBuilder instance variable called lineEditor.
 * You should have at least one constructor with one parameter. This constructor will take in a string.
 * Inside the constructor, you will instantiate a StringBuilder object with that string.
 * (Please follow the instructions in this section carefully.)
 * Besides that, you should also write a setLineEditor that will set
 * the StringBuilder variable to a new StringBuilder object and
 * getLineEditor method that will return the content of lineEditor.
 * You will then write the three methods listed above for each of the tasks that Editor can perform.
